# Facenality

According to a widespread [statistic](https://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/04/16/suche-nach-dem-doppelgaenger_n_7078760.html), every human being has seven doppelg√§nger in the world. That's not surprising. 
In the course of life we have met many people who are similar to others. It becomes interesting when one observes and realizes that people who look similar, usually do not only have **similar facial** features, but also **similar behavioral features**.

Facenality is here to investigate this matter scientifically by collecting photos of faces and personality reports,
to be evaluated by a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

A team of [chinese scientists](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318159328_Physiognomy_Personality_traits_prediction_by_learning) has been faster than I and achieved positive results in 06/17 - Nice work there!
